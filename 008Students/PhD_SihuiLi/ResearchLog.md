### Research Goals by the end of this semester

1. Finish literature review: test code if needed and from the literatures, come up with possible new algorithm ides. 

2. Form a plan for completing the paper submission for RSS, based on what is done in the course project and what I currently have in algorithm side.

   # Tasks

   - Test TP-GMR code from Calinon
   - look at other incremental learning algorithms and decremental learning, for literature review and new ideas.
   - test running time for incremental GMM and regular GMM
   - literature review at different layer
   - literature review for the paper and literature review for summarization
   - plan ahead.
